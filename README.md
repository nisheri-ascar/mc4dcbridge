# mc4dcbridge
My first, ugly javascript project that is definitely not stolen from https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/blob/master/examples/discord.js
Yes i know theres other implementation of this thats better and robust, but fuck you let me suffer and learn

# Usage
Create `.env` file at the same path of `bot.js` it should contain
```
TOKEN=YOUR DISCORD TOKEN
channel=YOUR DISCORD CHANNEL (should be numbers)
```

# Todos
- [ ] Implement WebHook (i dunno if possible)

- [ ] Make names colored in game

- [ ] Disallow reply

- [ ] Implement music feature (Mainly i made this so me and my friends can listen music while ingame, without bothering to minimize minecraft ever)

# final words

I would like to thank my friends, coffee and minecraft for motivating me and prismarine-js example code, being my first project that took half of my brain cell for such a dumbass like me
